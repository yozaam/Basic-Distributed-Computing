## how to run a program e.g. BasicThree.java ?
- `download this repo and open cmd line`
- `cd < to wherever you saved these files >`

- `javac BasicThree.java` -> compile
- `java BasicThree` -> run

*And how to run client and server programs together??*
- Do the same as above in **2 separate** cmd/shell windows (run server first )!
- window 1: `javac Server.java` `java Server`
- window 2: `javac Client.java` `java Client`
# Experiment 1:
tasks and files:  
- write three basic programs -> BasicThree.java  
- use socket programming -> Client.java and Server.java

# Experiment 2
task
- write a server which takes a string and returns the cryptographic hash
